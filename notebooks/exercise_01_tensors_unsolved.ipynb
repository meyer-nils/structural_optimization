    "\n",
    "To solve the tasks with code, we will use a package called torch-fem. It is a differentiable finite element solver based on the PyTorch framework. PyTorch is a powerful Python package to operate on tensors. In comparison to NumPy, it stores gradients together with tensors and thus allows automatic differentiation. The package is used widely for machine learning and optimization. \n",

    "```bash\n",
    "    conda create -n \"struct_opt\" python\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "    pip install torch-fem\n",
